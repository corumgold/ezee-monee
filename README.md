# simpli.money

69% of Americans aren't saving enough to retire - many don't even have enough saved to cover a basic emergency. If you fall into one of these categories, this is a tool for you.

## The Dollars and Sense of it All

I am making this project because I have a passion for helping people make the most out of their hard earned dollars. Oftentimes, I find that I repeat myself a lot when it comes to savings and retirement advice. This tool will be a quick and easy way for someone at ANY point in their financial journey to figure out "what the heck do I do with my money?"
